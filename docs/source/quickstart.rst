  The following commands will install *landlab-rest* into your current environment. Although
  not necessary, we **highly recommend** you install *landlab-rest* into its own
  :ref:`virtual environment <virtual_environments>`.

.. include:: ../../README.rst
    :start-after: .. start-quickstart
    :end-before: .. end-quickstart

If you would like the very latest development version of *landlab-rest* or want to modify
or contribute code to the *landlab-rest* project, you will need to do a
:ref:`developer installation <developer_install>` of *landlab-rest* from source.
